# **Chattr**
### Conversational AI that learns from your WhatsApp chats.

###### Quickstart
* Export chats from WhatsApp, without media.
* Place txt files of all exported chats into the data/ folder.
* In the first cell of the notebook, replace my name with yours, the one that appears in the txt files.
* Start executing the notebook.
  * You can edit the network architecture, and experiment.
  * Stop the kernel whenever you want.
  * Execute the last two cells to test the network. The second-to-last one pulls examples from the dataset, and the last one takes custom input.
 * Read through the grammatically correct gibberish that appears on your screen, and try to make sense of it.
