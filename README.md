# **Chattr**
### Conversational AI that learns from your WhatsApp chats.

###### Quickstart
* Export chats from WhatsApp, without media.
* Place txt files of all exported chats into the data/ folder.
* In the first cell of the notebook, replace my name with yours, the one that appears in the txt files.
* Start executing the notebook.
  * You can edit the network architecture, and experiment.
  * Stop the kernel whenever you want.
  * Execute the last two cells to test the network. The second-to-last one pulls examples from the dataset, and the last one takes custom input.
 * Read through the grammatically correct gibberish that appears on your screen, and try to make sense of it.


The bad spelling is because all repeated letters are removed, because words like good are often written as goood, okay becomes okayyyyy, and so on. The repeated letters are removed so all of these variations match a single token in our corpus.

This is a great tool for reflection. In essence, it captures your personality. The generated texts reveal a lot about who you are.

This is a DEEP neural network.
